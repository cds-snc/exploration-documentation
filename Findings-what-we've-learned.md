# Findings: what we've learned 

As of April 2021, we've run 4 pilot Explorations with 3 departments and 4 programs. These are the documents that we generated at the end of each Exploration with our findings and recommendations. As we improved the service over time the format has changed, so there's a mix of presentations and reports.
